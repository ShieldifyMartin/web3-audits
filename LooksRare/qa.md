# Looks Rare

## QA Report

### L-01 Unused/empty `receive()`/`fallback()` function

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. require(msg.sender == address(weth))). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds

### L-02 Modifiers shouldnâ€™t update state

### L-03 No reverts even when `execute` delegatecall fails

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/LooksRareAggregator.sol

88: (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = singleTradeData.proxy.delegatecall(proxyCalldata);

### N-02 Event is missing `indexed` fields

Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields

36: event ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregatorSet();

44: event FeeUpdated(address proxy, uint256 bp, address recipient);
