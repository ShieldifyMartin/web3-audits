### N-02 `require()`/`revert()` statements should have descriptive reason strings

File: /contracts/Pool.sol

45: require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);

48: require(success);

71: require(_balances[from] >= amount);

72: require(to != address(0));
```

File: /contracts/Pool.sol

44: function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {

58: function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)

79: function balanceOf(address user) public view returns (uint256) {

83: function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
```

### N-04 Open TODOs

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_
